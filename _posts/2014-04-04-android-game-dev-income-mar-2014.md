Three months in and there has only still been the initial two purchases of [Mr. Tiddles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles) from the first month of release in January.

Although this is somewhat disappointing, but on the bright side, the ad revenue has seen a 3.6 fold increase! Unfortunately 3.6 times 49 cents isn't a alot, but it is improvement!

During March, I did not tweak any of the AdMob settings though did constantly tweet and promote the game via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrtiddlesgame), [Googe Plus](https://plus.google.com/b/108209349412582559435/108209349412582559435/posts) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dx3studios). 

Promotion via social media helped a little - installs increased steadily, but only at approximately one a day. April will be an interesting month, as I plan on cutting down the social media promotion to see how it will affect the install rate.

I do have some plans to make updates to the game and possibly release it on the Samsung Store to increase downloads, however time is tight and [procrastination](/2014/03/30/introducing-connect-three/) is hard to avoid!

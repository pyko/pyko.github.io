After many months of hacking away at the computer, learning to use Gimp and Inkscape, cursing at Google's horrible in-app billing testing environment, and general game dev stuff... my first game, [Mr. Tiddles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles) is now available on the Google Play Store!

It's a simple game in all aspects, but I'm still happy with the result. The main goal for this game has been achieved - create a game, finish it, and make it available on the Play Store for all to enjoy!

Throughout the process, I have learnt many many things - some which I have started to blog about, others which are still blog posts yet to be written.

So, if you feel like playing a simple game on the first day of 2014, head over to [the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles) and give Mr. Tiddles a whirl :)

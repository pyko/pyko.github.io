This is the second installment of my "Income Report" which details the revenue coming from [Mr. Tiddles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles).

As you can see, for the month of February, there were no in-app purchases, though the ads did generate a bit more revenue. If you're on the ball, you'll notice that the number of impressions this month has actually dropped to 585 compared to the 868 impressions in January.

      <td class="align-right">In-app purchase</td>
      <td class="align-center">$0.00</td>
      <td>No purchases</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td class="align-right">Ads</td>
      <td class="align-center">$0.49</td>
      <td>585 impressions, 4 clicks</td>
   </tr>
</table>

A reasonable guess would be that there were less people playing, however, this is not the case. In fact, due to my attempt to spread the word of Mr. Tiddles as much as possible halfway through February, the number of users actually increased.

So, why did the number of impressions decrease? Well, during most of January (and first half of February) I actually had the Refresh Rate set at 30 seconds. After doing some research into AdMob and mobile ads, it was clear that in general, a longer refresh rate is better. Therefore, I increased it to 90 seconds.

A quick summary for the reasoning behind a longer Refresh Rate is that it increases the chance a player will see and click an ad. Additionally, it will likely increase your Impressions CTR percentage as the denominator (ie. impressions) is smaller.

My attempt to increase the visibility for Mr. Tiddles seemed to work relatively well - not fantastic, but not bad either. Three main actions that I took were:

1. Created a dedicated twitter account: [@MrTiddleGame](https://twitter.com/mrtiddlesgame)
1. Created a facebook page: [dx3 studios](https://www.facebook.com/dx3studios)
1. Kept badgering friends about Mr. Tiddles :)

June's income report looks very much like the previous months, no purchases and 97c from ads for the month.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Amount</th>
      <th class="align-left">Note</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td class="align-right">In-app purchase</td>
      <td class="align-center">$0.00</td>
      <td>No purchases</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td class="align-right">Ads</td>
      <td class="align-center">$0.97</td>
      <td>607 impressions, 11 clicks</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Going to keep this one short as there's not much to say other than, yet another ~$1 month! 

Another reason is that I have a second game in the works! From one of my earlier posts, you'll see a weekend adventure which resulted in "[Connect Three](http://dx3.psychopyko.com/connect-three)". 

My next game will be based on Connect Three with changes and improvements from input/feedback from friends. The prototype is looking promising... stay tuned!

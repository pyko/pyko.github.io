After much neglect, I am finally going to make an effort to blog semi-regularly about random Android stuff, in particular development. The first step (completely unecessary, but so fun) was to migrate the blog from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) :)

For the curious, the two posts from 2011 were migrated from the old blog to here as I felt they still had value and would be useful. Hopefully, there will be many more useful/interesting blog posts to come!

Roughly 6 weeks ago, my first Android game [Mr. Tiddles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles) was released into the wild. So now I think it is time to have a look at some stats!

To keep things simple, the below numbers are before tax and before Google takes their 30% cut.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Amount</th>
      <th class="align-left">Note</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td class="align-right">In-app purchase</td>
      <td class="align-center">$2.11</td>
      <td>Two purchases</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td class="align-right">Ads</td>
      <td class="align-center">$0.08</td>
      <td>868 impressions, 2 clicks</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Unfortunately, unlike Flappy Bird, instead of the rumoured $50k a day \**dreams*\*, it is a humble **$2.19** for the month - with Google and the tax-man stil to take their share.

Honestly, I was actually expecting more, but I guess it is a start. Sadly, the number of new/active users seem to have plateaued so realistically the expected report for February will probably look even sadder.

One of the ways to increase the app's potential income would be to increase the number of users. To increase the number of users, I will need to make an update of the app and/or do some form of marketing and hope that more users will leave reviews for the app.

If you have any ideas, let me know at [@dx3droid](https://twitter.com/dx3droid) - I'm all ears!

Of course, if you download [Mr. Tiddles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychopyko.dx3.mrtiddles) and [give it 5 minutes](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes)* of play time, leave a nice review, share with friends etc you will make me super happy :)
